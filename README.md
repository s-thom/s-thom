## About me

I'm a guy that writes code. Whether anybody uses it or not doesn't really matter.

## This README

I've had the idea to use animated SVG in a README for some time, and I thought my profile was the perfect place to start off.

- [Jost\* (Typeface)](https://indestructibletype.com/Jost.html)
- [CSS Tricks: A Guide to SVG Animations](https://css-tricks.com/guide-svg-animations-smil/)
- [SVG wave animation generator](https://loading.io/background/m-wave/)

And here's some other things that got me thinking about SVG in general, and may show up in later projects.

- [CSS Tricks: The Gooey Effect](https://css-tricks.com/gooey-effect/)
- [HTML + CSS in a GitHub README](https://github.com/cirosantilli/test-git-web-interface/blob/master/svg-foreignObject.svg) (I'm definitely using this later)
