## About me

I'm a guy that writes code. Whether anybody uses it or not doesn't really matter.

## This README

The SVG used at the top of this README is based on the version I use on my [personal website](https://sthom.kiwi). It's done in pure SVG using [SMIL](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/SVG/SVG_animation_with_SMIL), and barely scratches the surface of what's possible in SVG. This version uses quadratic bezier curves that animate their control points, leading to the appearance of the waves changing and overlapping.

- [SVG wave animation generator](https://loading.io/background/m-wave/) (the original inspiration for my own implementation)
